# Folder Schema

Here is an example of a suggested folder schema for a project that combines FastAPI as a Python backend with SvelteKit and Vercel as the front-end:

- `backend/`
  - `app/`
    - `main.py` (Main FastAPI application file)
    - `routes/`
      - `api/`
        - `chat.py` (FastAPI router for chat functionality)
  - `chatbot/`
    - `chatbot.py` (Python script or module for the chatbot logic)
- `frontend/`
  - `src/`
    - `routes/`
      - `api/`
        - `chat.js` (Front-end JavaScript module for making API requests to the chat endpoint)
    - Other SvelteKit source files and components
    - Front-end build output folder (e.g., `build/`)
- Other project configuration files
