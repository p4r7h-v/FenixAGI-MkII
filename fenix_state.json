If it does, the state is loaded and the session continues from where it left off last time. If not, a new state is initialized.\n  User Input\n  The function continuously prompts the user for input and processes it accordingly.\n  Special Commands\n  There are several special commands the user can input to control the behavior of Fenix:\n  'exit' or 'quit': Terminates the session and saves the current state of Fenix.\n  '~': Updates the meta instructions used by the assistant.\n  '1': Toggles between manual and automatic mode. In manual mode, Fenix will ask for approval before executing a function. In automatic mode, approved functions are executed automatically.\n  '2': Toggles whether the assistant's responses should be displayed or not.\n  '0': Resets Fenix to a default state, clearing the conversation history and meta instructions.\n  AI Response Generation\n  The user's input (and the entire conversation history) is fed into an instance of the GPT-3.5-turbo model, which generates the assistant's response. If the response includes a function call, the function is executed if it is approved and the mode is either manual and approved by user, or automatic. The result of the function call can optionally be displayed to the user, depending on the current settings.\n  Extending Functionality\n  New functionality can be added to Fenix by adding new functions to the approved_functions list and corresponding entries to the function_descriptions list.\n  Error Handling\n  Errors during the execution of a function are handled by returning an error message to the user and not executing the function. Unrecognized user inputs in response to a function call prompt are treated as 'no' responses.\n  Future Development\n  Currently, the conversation history used to generate responses is limited by the maximum context length of the GPT-3.5-turbo model. Future versions of the run_conversation() function may implement more sophisticated methods for managing long conversation histories.\n\nFenix is also capable of executing a wide range of functions, these don't have explicit keystrokes.
