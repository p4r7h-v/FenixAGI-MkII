Goal: combine multiple python scripts into one
Strategies: 
Strategy 1: Merge the scripts by importing their functions into a main script and call them sequentially.
Strategy 2: Merge the scripts into a single file using import statements and function calls, ensuring compatibility and seamless execution.Strategy 3: Merge the scripts by importing the functions/classes from individual scripts into a new single script and call them as needed. 
Generating pros and cons...
Pros and Cons: 1. Merge the scripts by importing their functions into a main script and call them sequentially.
Pros: Easy to implement and maintain, keeps code organized.
Cons: May not be efficient if some functions are not needed in certain cases.

2. Merge the scripts into a single file using import statements and function calls, ensuring compatibility and seamless execution.
Pros: All code in one place, easier to debug and maintain.
Cons: Can become cluttered and harder to read as the file grows.

3. Merge the scripts by importing the functions/classes from individual scripts into a new single script and call them as needed. 
Pros: Provides flexibility in calling functions, maintains code organization.
Cons: Requires careful management of imports and dependencies.

Generating strategy...
Strategy: To combine multiple Python scripts into one, follow these steps:

1. Organize your scripts: Ensure that all the individual scripts are in the same directory or a known location.

2. Create a new script: Create a new Python script (e.g., `combined_script.py`) in the same directory as the individual scripts.

3. Import functions/classes: In the new script, import the functions or classes from the individual scripts using the `from script_name import function_name/class_name` syntax. For example, if you have a script called `script1.py` with a function named `function1`, you would write `from script1 import function1`.

4. Call functions/classes: In the `combined_script.py`, call the imported functions or classes as needed. For example, if you imported `function1` from `script1.py`, you can call it by simply writing `function1()`.

5. Handle name conflicts: If there are functions or classes with the same name in different scripts, you can use the `as` keyword to give them an alias. For example, `from script1 import function1 as func1`.

6. Add a main function: To control the execution flow, create a `main()` function in the `combined_script.py`. Inside the `main()` function, call the imported functions or classes in the desired order.

7. Execute the main function: At the end of the `combined_script.py`, add the following lines to execute the `main()` function:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

8. Test the combined script: Run the `combined_script.py` to ensure that it works as expected. If there are any issues, debug and fix them 
accordingly.

By following these steps, you can effectively combine multiple Python scripts into a single, cohesive script.

Goal: I have python scripts that can create notion pages, code, read documents, chat, use GPT api calls, how do I combine htei functionality into a single agent?
Strategies: 
Strategy 1: Create a modular Python program with specialized functions for each task, then use a main function to manage and execute the required tasks based on user input.
Strategy 2: Create a unified Python script incorporating all functionalities by implementing dedicated classes and methods for each feature, and integrating them through a common interface or controller.
Strategy 3: Integrate all functionalities into a master script using a modular approach with appropriate functions.
Generating pros and cons...
Pros and Cons: 1. Modular Python program:
Pros: Easy to maintain and extend, promotes code reusability.
Cons: May require more initial setup and planning.

2. Unified Python script with dedicated classes and methods:
Pros: Centralized codebase, easier to understand the overall structure.
Cons: Can become complex and harder to maintain as the codebase grows.

3. Master script with modular approach:
Pros: Combines benefits of modularity and a centralized script.
Cons: Can still become complex if not well-organized.

Best=1, as it provides better maintainability, code reusability, and easier extension of functionalities.
Generating strategy...
Strategy: To accomplish this strategy, follow these steps:

1. Organize your code into separate modules:
   - Create a folder for your project, e.g., `my_agent`.
   - Inside the folder, create separate Python files for each functionality, e.g., `notion_pages.py`, `code_generator.py`, `document_reader.py`, `chat.py`, and `gpt_api.py`.

2. Implement functions for each task in their respective modules:
   - In `notion_pages.py`, create functions to create and manage Notion pages.
   - In `code_generator.py`, create functions to generate code.
   - In `document_reader.py`, create functions to read and process documents.
   - In `chat.py`, create functions to handle chat interactions.
   - In `gpt_api.py`, create functions to interact with the GPT API.

3. Create a `main.py` file to manage and execute tasks:
   - Import the necessary functions from your modules, e.g., `from notion_pages import create_page`.
   - Create a function to process user input and determine which task to execute, e.g., `def process_input(input: str) -> None`.
   - Inside `process_input`, use conditional statements to call the appropriate functions based on the user input.
   - Create a `main` function to run the program, which should include a loop to continuously accept user input and call `process_input` to execute tasks.
   - Add the standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the end of the file to call the `main` function when the script is executed.   

4. Test your program:
   - Run `main.py` and test each functionality by providing the appropriate user input.
   - Debug and refine your code as needed.

Here's a basic example of how your `main.py` file might look:

```python
from notion_pages import create_page
from code_generator import generate_code
from document_reader import read_document
from chat import chat_interaction
from gpt_api import gpt_api_call

def process_input(input: str) -> None:
    if input.startswith("create notion page"):
        create_page()
    elif input.startswith("generate code"):
        generate_code()
    elif input.startswith("read document"):
        read_document()
    elif input.startswith("chat"):
        chat_interaction()
    elif input.startswith("gpt api call"):
        gpt_api_call()
    else:
        print("Invalid command")

def main():
    while True:
        user_input = input("Enter command: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        process_input(user_input)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By following this strategy, you'll have a modular and organized Python program that combines the functionalities of creating Notion pages, 
generating code, reading documents, chatting, and using GPT API calls into a single agent.
