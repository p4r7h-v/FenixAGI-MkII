However, this script doesn't navigate links to sub-pages or extract text outside of paragraph tags, and may miss content on the page.\n\nKeep in mind that Wikimedia sites have APIs that can provide the content you're looking for in a more structured and respectful manner.  \nCheck the MediaWiki API for more information. \n\nAlso, be aware that this is a very simplified form of web scraping, and more complex scenarios might necessitate usage of a more advanced framework, such as Scrapy.", "tokens_used": 336}, {"purpose": "a bot that creates, reads, updates, and deletes data in a database", "code": "Sure, the following is a basic implementation of a bot in Python that manages a database using sqlite3.
