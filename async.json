[{"purpose": "script that uses beautifulsoup to scrape a website and save the results", "code": "BeautifulSoup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. Here is a general purpose function to scrape a website and save the results:\n\nPlease note that this function requires the 'requests' and 'beautifulsoup4' libraries. You can install these via pip:\n\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef scrape_website(url):\n    # Send a HTTP request to the URL of the webpage you want to access\n    response = requests.get(url)\n\n    # If the HTTP request has been successful, the status code will be 200\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        # Get the content of the response\n        page_content = response.content\n\n        # Create a BeautifulSoup object and specify the parser\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, 'html.parser')\n\n        # Empty list to hold scraped data\n        scraped_data = []\n\n        # Find elements you need - in this case, let's say we are finding 'p' elements\n        elements = soup.find_all('p')\n        \n        # Iterate through each element of interest\n        for element in elements:\n            # Append the data to scraped_data list\n            scraped_data.append(element.text)\n\n        # Write data to a file\n        with open('scraped_data.txt', 'w') as f:\n            for item in scraped_data:\n                f.write(\"%s\\n\" % item)\n\n        print('Data scraped and saved successfully.')\n    else:\n        print('Failed to retrieve page.')\n\n# Use the function\nscrape_website('https://www.example.com')\n```\n\nThis is a very basic scraper and you will have to modify it to specifically match the site you are scraping as HTML markup differs from site to site.\n\nThis script finds all 'p' elements and saves the text inside them to a text file. You would typically need to inspect the HTML structure of the site you are scraping to determine what parts you want to extract.\n\nPlease also consider the legality and ethics concerning web scraping, and respect websites' terms of service and robots.txt files.", "tokens_used": 479}, {"purpose": "script that uses bing API to search for a query and save the results", "code": "To write a Python script that uses the Bing API to search a query and save the results, you'll need a Bing Search v7 subscription key, which you can get from Azure. \n\nBelow is an example function that takes a search query as a parameter and saves the resulting URLs to a text file:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef bing_search_save(query):\n    subscription_key = \"Your-Bing-Search-v7-Subscription-Key\"\n    base_url = \"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search\"\n    \n    headers = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": subscription_key}\n    params = {\"q\": query, \"count\": 50, \"offset\": 0}\n    \n    response = requests.get(base_url, headers=headers, params=params)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    search_results = response.json()\n\n    with open('bing_search_results.txt', 'w') as file:\n        for result in search_results[\"webPages\"][\"value\"]:\n            file.write(result[\"url\"] + \"\\n\")\n\n\n# Execute function with a search query\nbing_search_save(\"python programming\")\n```\n\nThis function uses `requests.get` to send a GET request to the Bing Search API. The result, stored in `response`, is converted into JSON format and written out to a text file called `bing_search_results.txt`.\n\nKeep in mind you need to replace \"Your-Bing-Search-v7-Subscription-Key\" with your actual subscription key. \n\nRemember that the Bing Search v7 API has a limit on the number of search results it returns. The maximum value for the \"count\" parameter is 50, and each search can return a maximum of 1050 results by adjusting the \"offset\" parameter.\n\nPlease install necessary libraries by running the command `pip install requests` if not installed.*/\n", "tokens_used": 424}, {"purpose": "script that uses google API to search for a query and save the results", "code": "To write this function, you need to have Google API credentials. Google's search APIs are complex to use and currently Google's Custom Search JSON API and Programmable Search Engine are the recommended ways.\n\nHere's an example of a Python function for making a query using Google Custom Search JSON API:\n\nPlease note some things:\n- You need to set up a Programmable Search Engine (formerly known as custom search engine) in the Google Developers Console and get your `cx` key (search engine id).\n- The service is not free and you are billed per usage. \n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef search_google(query, api_key, cx_key):\n    URL = f\"https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1\"\n    PARAMETERS = {'q':query, 'key':api_key, 'cx':cx_key}\n\n    response = requests.get(URL, params=PARAMETERS)\n    response_json = response.json()\n\n    # Save the results to a JSON file\n    with open('results.json', 'w') as outfile:\n        json.dump(response_json, outfile)\n\n    print(\"Results are saved in results.json\")\n```\nYou can call this function by passing your `query`, `api_key`, and `cx_key` like this:\n```python\nsearch_google('Your search query', 'Your Gooogle API key', 'Your Google custom search engine ID')\n```\nRemember to replace `'Your search query'`, `'Your Google API key'`, and `'Your Google custom search engine ID'` with your real parameters. \n\nNote: The returned JSON contains a lot of information you might not need. It might be necessary to parse it to save only the required data.\nAlso, the use of this API has costs associated with it after a certain number of requests.\n\nFor a more sophisticated or different type of search, you may need to use or develop a more robust implementation using Google's API python client library, which allows for added complexity like paging through results. This, however, is a simple illustration of a concept that can be expanded and tailored to various specific needs.\n", "tokens_used": 472}]
